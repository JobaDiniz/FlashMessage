WPF FlashMessage
================

This is custom control that provides a way to alert users whether an operation was successfully completed or not.
Why use MessageBox when you have the powerfull WPF in your hands?

The Motivation
--------------

Aren't you tired of all the MessageBoxes on your applications? Isn't there a better way to alert users whether an
operation was successfully completed? For years I used MessageBox or a static label in WinForms applications,
and they came with me when I started to migrate to WPF.

However, WPF is so much more powerfull than that, and I thought why not create something different?
Because let's face it, using MessageBox is like using javascript alert function in a web page, don't you think?.
So it is settle, we need something new, but what? Well, once I was a Rails developer and Rails has a interesting
flash message system, so I thought of creating a control that acts slightly similar.
